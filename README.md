## Project Overview
This project focuses on analysis for DEEZ mobile application. The aim is to generate insights from user user retention and engagement data, create meaningful visualizations, and build a user-level insights. This project addresses four key questions:

1. **1**: In the "1- event_analysis" query, Focusing on the most-watched memes and their distribution charts. Also,  aiming to detect patterns and forecasts by separating the watch times.
2. **2**: In the "2.a - Engagement_by_source_keyword", "2.b - average_event", "2.b - Segmentation", and "2.bonus - each_user_segment" queries, Working on segmenting the players. Based on this segmentation, Identifiying the distributions of low, middle, and high engagement users and specified the average number of meme views in these segments.
3. **3**: In the "3 - Retention & Engagement Funnel" query, Determined the players' retention metrics and their view distributions by day.

## Visualizing and Query tools
During this analysis,
I used **Looker Studio** to visualize key segments and KPIs. 
I used **BigQUery** for SQL queries in this analysis.

## How to Run the SQL Queries
1. Use a BigQuery or any SQL-compatible environment to run the SQL files.
2. Load the queries into your SQL environment and execute them against your dataset.
3. Use Looker Studio for visualizing the results of these queries, especially for segmentations.
